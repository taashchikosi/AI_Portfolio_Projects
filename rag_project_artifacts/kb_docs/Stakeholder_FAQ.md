# Stakeholder FAQ — Energy Efficiency Decision-Support Model

## 1. What is this tool designed to do?
This tool is designed to support **decision-making related to energy efficiency** by providing directional insights into potential energy savings and their drivers.

It helps users:
- Compare efficiency improvement options
- Prioritise investments
- Explore “what-if” scenarios
- Support early-stage ESG and sustainability discussions

It does not replace professional assessments or guarantee outcomes.

---

## 2. Is this a prediction or a guarantee?
No.

The model provides **indicative, scenario-based estimates** intended to inform decisions.  
Actual outcomes depend on site-specific conditions, implementation quality, and operational behaviour.

---

## 3. Can this tool provide certified energy ratings?
No.

This tool:
- Does not calculate certified energy ratings
- Does not replace accredited assessors
- Does not replicate formal assessment methodologies

Certified ratings require verified operational data and accredited processes.

---

## 4. Does this tool give NABERS ratings?
No.

This tool does **not** calculate or certify NABERS ratings.  
It may support **pre-assessment decision-making**, such as identifying improvement opportunities before engaging accredited NABERS assessors.

---

## 5. Can outputs be used for ESG or sustainability reporting?
Outputs may support **internal analysis and planning**, but they are **not formal ESG disclosures**.

Any external or public-facing ESG reporting requires:
- Verified data
- Documented assumptions
- Appropriate governance and review

---

## 6. How reliable are the results?
Reliability depends on:
- Input data quality
- Similarity to typical building scenarios
- Scope and complexity of interventions

The tool includes qualitative confidence indicators to support responsible interpretation.

---

## 7. When should human expert review be involved?
Human review is recommended when:
- Confidence is assessed as low
- Decisions involve significant capital expenditure
- Outputs are used in ESG or strategic communications
- Scenarios involve atypical or extreme assumptions

Human oversight is a core requirement of responsible use.

---

## 8. What kinds of decisions does this tool support?
This tool supports decisions such as:
- Which efficiency measures to prioritise
- Where to focus limited capital or effort
- Whether a building is ready for further assessment
- How to frame energy efficiency initiatives responsibly

It supports **planning and prioritisation**, not final approval or certification.

---

## 9. What are the main limitations of this tool?
Key limitations include:
- Simplified representation of complex systems
- Lack of site-specific engineering detail
- Dependence on assumed operating conditions
- Inability to capture behavioural and organisational factors

Results should be interpreted accordingly.

---

## 10. How should this tool be used responsibly?
Responsible use includes:
- Understanding and communicating limitations
- Avoiding overclaiming or implied compliance
