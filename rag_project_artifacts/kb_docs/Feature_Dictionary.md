# Feature Dictionary — Energy Efficiency Decision-Support Model

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the input features used by the energy-efficiency model in clear, non-technical language.

The goal is to:
- Explain what each feature represents
- Clarify why it matters for energy performance
- Support transparent interpretation of model outputs

This dictionary is intended for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## 2. Feature Definitions

### floor_area_m2
**Description:**  
Total conditioned floor area of the building, measured in square metres (m²).

**Why it matters:**  
Larger buildings generally consume more energy in absolute terms and often exhibit different efficiency dynamics due to scale, system sizing, and operational complexity.

---

### occupancy_type
**Description:**  
Primary use type of the building (e.g. office, retail, education, mixed-use).

**Why it matters:**  
Different occupancy types have distinct:
- operating hours
- internal loads
- equipment usage
- energy demand patterns

These factors strongly influence baseline consumption and savings potential.

---

### baseline_eui
**Description:**  
Baseline Energy Use Intensity (EUI), expressed as annual energy consumption per square metre (kWh/m²/year).

**Why it matters:**  
Baseline EUI provides a normalised indicator of how energy-intensive a building is prior to interventions.  
Buildings with higher baseline EUI often present greater opportunities for efficiency improvements.

### hvac_efficiency
**Description:**  
A proxy or rated measure of HVAC system efficiency (e.g. COP, efficiency score, or relative rating).

**Why it matters:**  
HVAC systems typically represent the largest share of building energy use.  
Improvements in HVAC efficiency can have a disproportionate impact on overall energy savings.

---

### lighting_power_density
**Description:**  
Lighting Power Density (LPD), measured in watts per square metre (W/m²).

**Why it matters:**  
Lighting efficiency affects both:
- direct electricity consumption
- indirect cooling loads (heat generated by lighting)

Lower LPD values generally indicate more efficient lighting systems.

---

### controls_score
**Description:**  
A qualitative or quantitative indicator of building controls maturity, such as:
- scheduling
- occupancy sensors
- Building Management System (BMS) sophistication

**Why it matters:**  
Operational controls strongly influence real-world energy performance.  
Even efficient equipment can underperform without effective control strategies.

---

## 3. Interpretation Notes
- Feature values are assumed to represent typical operating conditions
- Incomplete or estimated inputs may reduce confidence in predictions
- Feature interactions can influence outcomes (e.g. lighting affects cooling demand)

---

## 4. Governance Considerations
- Features are used for **decision support**, not compliance certification
- Inputs should be reviewed by a knowledgeable practitioner for high-stakes decisions
- Mis-specified features can lead to misleading outputs

---

## 5. Limitations
- Not all real-world variables can be captured as model features
- Behavioural and operational nuances may not be fully represented
- Feature definitions may evolve as the model is refined

This dictionary should be updated alongside any material changes to the model.
