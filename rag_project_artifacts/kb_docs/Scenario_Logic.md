# Scenario Logic — Energy Efficiency Decision-Support Model

## 1. Purpose
This document explains how the model supports **scenario-based analysis** for energy-efficiency decision making.

Scenario logic allows users to explore:
- Baseline versus improvement conditions
- Relative impact of different interventions
- Directional changes in energy performance under alternative assumptions

Scenarios are used for **exploration and prioritisation**, not final design or certification.

---

## 2. Baseline Scenario
The baseline scenario represents the building’s current or assumed operating state.

Baseline inputs typically include:
- Existing building size and occupancy type
- Current energy use intensity
- Present HVAC efficiency levels
- Existing lighting power density
- Current operational control maturity

The baseline provides a reference point against which all intervention scenarios are compared.

---

## 3. Intervention Scenarios
Intervention scenarios represent **hypothetical improvements** applied to the baseline.

Examples include:
- Improved HVAC efficiency
- Reduced lighting power density
- Enhanced operational controls
- Combinations of multiple improvements

Each intervention modifies one or more input features while holding others constant, enabling clear attribution of impact.

---

## 4. Scenario Comparison Logic
The model evaluates scenarios by:
- Estimating energy savings relative to the baseline
- Comparing outcomes across alternative interventions
- Highlighting which changes produce the largest directional effect

Results are expressed as **relative differences**, not absolute guarantees.

---

## 5. Interaction Effects
Some interventions interact with others, for example:
- Reduced lighting loads can lower cooling demand
- Improved controls can amplify the benefits of efficient equipment
- Diminishing returns may occur at higher efficiency levels

The model captures these interactions at a simplified, aggregate level.

---

## 6. Interpretation Guidance
Scenario outputs should be interpreted as:
- Directional indicators of potential impact
- Inputs to further technical analysis
- Tools for narrowing down viable options

Scenarios are most valuable when used to **compare alternatives**, not to predict exact outcomes.

---

## 7. Limitations
Scenario analysis does not account for:
- Detailed engineering constraints
- Installation and commissioning quality
- Behavioural or organisational change
- Site-specific operational anomalies

As a result, scenario results should inform **next steps**, not final decisions.

---

## 8. Governance and Responsible Use
Scenario analysis supports:
- Early-stage planning
- Capital prioritisation discussions
- Pre-assessment readiness evaluations

It does not replace:
- Detailed energy modelling
- Engineering design
- Accredited assessments (e.g. NABERS)

Human judgment remains essential.
