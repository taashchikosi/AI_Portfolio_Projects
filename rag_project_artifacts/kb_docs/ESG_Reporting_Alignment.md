# ESG Reporting Alignment — Energy Efficiency Decision-Support Model

## 1. Purpose
This document explains how outputs from the energy-efficiency decision-support model may be **contextually aligned** with common ESG reporting frameworks.

The objective is to:
- Support internal ESG and sustainability discussions
- Provide framework-aware interpretation of results
- Avoid misrepresentation or overstatement of compliance

This project does **not** generate formal ESG disclosures.

---

## 2. General ESG Context
Energy efficiency is a core component of environmental performance across most ESG frameworks, particularly in relation to:
- Operational emissions
- Resource efficiency
- Climate risk mitigation
- Transition planning

Model outputs can inform **internal decision-making** related to these themes, but do not constitute reportable metrics on their own.

---

## 3. Alignment with the GHG Protocol
The GHG Protocol provides guidance for accounting and reporting greenhouse gas emissions.

In relation to this framework:
- Model outputs can support **internal analysis** of potential Scope 2 reduction opportunities
- Energy savings estimates may inform prioritisation of emissions reduction initiatives
- Any translation to emissions requires additional data and documented assumptions

The model does **not** calculate official Scope 1, 2, or 3 emissions inventories.

## 4. Alignment with TCFD Recommendations
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) focuses on climate-related risks and opportunities.

This project can support TCFD-aligned thinking by:
- Identifying opportunities to reduce operational energy exposure
- Informing discussions around transition risk mitigation
- Supporting scenario-based exploration of efficiency investments

Outputs may contribute to internal analysis under TCFD categories but are not disclosures themselves.

---

## 5. Alignment with ISSB / IFRS Sustainability Standards
The ISSB climate standards (e.g. IFRS S2) emphasise decision-useful information related to climate risks and opportunities.

Within this context, the model can:
- Support identification of energy-related efficiency opportunities
- Inform internal assessment of operational performance trends
- Assist with prioritisation of climate-related actions

Formal reporting under ISSB standards requires verified data, controls, and governance beyond this model.

## 6. NABERS Context (Australia)
In the Australian context, NABERS is a widely used operational performance rating system.

This model:
- Does not calculate or certify NABERS ratings
- Does not replicate accredited assessment methodologies
- Does not replace NABERS assessors

However, it may support **pre-assessment decision-making**, such as:
- Identifying improvement areas prior to formal assessment
- Prioritising upgrades likely to influence operational performance
- Improving readiness before engaging accredited professionals

---

## 7. Interpretation Boundaries
Outputs from this project should be interpreted as:
- Internal decision-support inputs
- Directional indicators
- Planning and prioritisation aids

They should **not** be interpreted as:
- Verified ESG performance metrics
- Regulatory or compliance disclosures
- Public-facing ESG claims without further validation

---

## 8. Governance Statement
Responsible ESG use of this project requires:
- Clear communication of assumptions and limitations
- Avoidance of overclaiming or implied compliance
- Human review for high-stakes or external use

This alignment document supports **framework awareness**, not certification.
