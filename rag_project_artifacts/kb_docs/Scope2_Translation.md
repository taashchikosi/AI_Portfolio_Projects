# Scope 2 Translation — Energy Efficiency Decision-Support Model

## 1. Purpose
This document explains how estimated energy savings from the model can be interpreted in the context of **Scope 2 emissions**.

The objective is to:
- Provide conceptual linkage between energy performance and emissions
- Support responsible internal ESG discussions
- Avoid overclaiming or misrepresentation of emissions outcomes

This document does not provide certified emissions calculations.

---

## 2. What Scope 2 Represents
Scope 2 emissions refer to **indirect greenhouse gas emissions** associated with the generation of purchased electricity, heating, cooling, or steam consumed by a building.

In most commercial buildings, electricity-related emissions represent a significant portion of total operational emissions.

---

## 3. Relationship Between Energy Savings and Scope 2
Energy savings estimated by the model are expressed in **directional terms** and can be conceptually linked to Scope 2 emissions as follows:

- Reduced electricity consumption generally leads to lower Scope 2 emissions
- The magnitude of emissions reduction depends on the emissions intensity of the electricity supply
- Emissions intensity varies by location, grid mix, and time period

As a result, energy savings should be interpreted as **potential emissions reduction opportunities**, not fixed outcomes.

---

## 4. Emissions Factors and Assumptions
Any translation from energy savings (kWh) to emissions outcomes requires the use of an **emissions factor**, which represents the average emissions per unit of electricity consumed.

Key considerations include:
- Emissions factors vary by jurisdiction and year
- Grid decarbonisation can materially change emissions outcomes over time
- Assumed emissions factors must be documented when used

This model does not prescribe specific emissions factors.

## 5. Interpretation Guidance
Outputs from this project can support:
- Internal assessment of where energy efficiency may contribute to emissions reduction goals
- Prioritisation of interventions with higher potential emissions impact
- Early-stage ESG strategy discussions

Outputs should **not** be presented as:
- Verified Scope 2 emissions reductions
- Formal disclosures
- Guaranteed environmental outcomes

---

## 6. Relationship to Building Ratings and Assessments
While operational energy performance influences building rating outcomes, this model:
- Does not calculate official ratings
- Does not replace accredited assessments
- Does not replicate assessor methodologies

Energy savings insights may support **pre-assessment decision-making** only.

---

## 7. Governance and Responsible Use
To ensure responsible use:
- All emissions-related interpretations should include clear assumptions
- Uncertainty should be explicitly acknowledged
- High-stakes or public-facing claims should undergo human review

This document supports governance-aligned interpretation of results.

---

## 8. Summary
This project provides **directional insight** into how energy efficiency improvements may influence Scope 2 emissions.

It supports decision-making and prioritisation, while recognising that formal emissions accounting requires additional data, assumptions, and verification.
