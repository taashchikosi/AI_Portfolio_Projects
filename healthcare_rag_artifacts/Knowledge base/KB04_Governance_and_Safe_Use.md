Governance, Limitations & Safe Use
1) Intended Use
	•	Early warning 
	•	Operational prioritisation 
	•	Decision support for human review 

2) Non-Intended Use
	•	❌ Clinical triage 
	•	❌ Automated staffing decisions 
	•	❌ Compliance reporting 
	•	❌ Individual patient decisions 

3) Human Review Trigger
A HIGH risk flag is triggered when:
	•	Predicted max occupancy ≥ 95%, OR 
	•	Predicted mean wait ≥ 120 minutes 
This flag indicates review is required, not that action must be taken.

4) Confidence Guidance
	•	High confidence: Consistent trends, moderate predictions 
	•	Medium confidence: Elevated but stable forecasts 
	•	Low confidence: Extreme values or unusual conditions 

5) Communication Guardrails
	•	Avoid deterministic language 
	•	Emphasise uncertainty and assumptions 
	•	Present outputs as inputs to decision-making
