Operational Screening Playbook (Non-Prescriptive)
LOW Risk
	•	Continue routine monitoring 
	•	Validate data inputs 
	•	Re-run forecast periodically 

HIGH Risk
	•	Review staffing availability 
	•	Check discharge and admission pipelines 
	•	Validate arrival assumptions 
	•	Escalate to operations leadership for situational awareness 
(Actions are contextual and require human judgment.)

Recommended Follow-Up Questions
	•	Are arrivals trending unusually? 
	•	Are discharge delays emerging? 
	•	Is staffing constrained beyond baseline? 
	•	Are external events expected? 

Data That Would Improve Confidence
	•	Real-time ED arrivals 
	•	Discharge forecasts 
	•	Staffing rosters 
	•	Elective procedure schedules
